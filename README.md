## MortalityPrediction

- Implements multiple conventional Survival Analysis models - Cox Proportional Hazards Model, Random Survival Forest - and novel Deep Learning based architectures proposed in the referenced papers - DeepHit, DeepSurv - to be benchmarked on the Framingham Heart Study Dataset.

- Implements a Mortality Prediction technique to use classical ML models - Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Extra Tree Classifiers - to be used on Survival Analysis data (sequential nature) to be benchmarked on the Framingham Heat Study Dataset

- Report multiple evaluation metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score in the 2 forms of frameworks for Mortality Prediction i.e. with and without resampling
